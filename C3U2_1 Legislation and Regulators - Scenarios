## Question 1: Roles of ASIC and APRA

A) ASIC for the cyberattack; APRA for the misleading advertising.  
B) APRA for the cyberattack; ASIC for the misleading advertising.

## Question 2: Product Design and Distribution Obligations (DDO)
**Scenario:** A superannuation fund launches a high-risk investment option and prepares a Target Market Determination (TMD). It later finds that 25% of customers purchasing the product do not fit the target market profile, potentially causing financial harm. What is the fund’s obligation under the DDO regime?

A) No action is required, as 25% is below the threshold for concern.  
B) Notify ASIC of the discrepancy and review the TMD.  
C) Immediately withdraw the product from the market.  
D) Offer refunds to all customers who purchased the product.

**Correct Answer:** B) Notify ASIC of the discrepancy and review the TMD.  

**Explanation:** Under the Design and Distribution Obligations (DDO) regime, as outlined in ASIC’s Regulatory Guide 274, issuers must notify ASIC of “significant dealings” not consistent with the TMD within 10 business days. A 25% mismatch suggests potential harm, requiring the fund to review the TMD to ensure it remains appropriate.
