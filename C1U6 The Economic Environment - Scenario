### Question 1
**Scenario:** A small business owner in Melbourne notices a decline in customer spending after the government increases income taxes to fund infrastructure projects. An economic analyst reports that this has led to reduced retail sales, impacting the overall economy. The analyst references microeconomic principles to explain the change in consumer behavior.

**Question:** Based on the document, how does the government’s tax increase relate to microeconomics, and what is the likely macroeconomic impact on the economy?

A) Microeconomics: affects supply and demand; Macroeconomic impact: lower economic growth.  
B) Microeconomics: sets interest rates; Macroeconomic impact: increased inflation.  
C) Microeconomics: regulates employment; Macroeconomic impact: higher net foreign debt.  
D) Microeconomics: controls exports; Macroeconomic impact: increased retail sales.

**Correct Answer:** A) Microeconomics: affects supply and demand; Macroeconomic impact: lower economic growth.  
**Explanation:** The document explains that microeconomics studies decisions affecting resource allocation and prices, including the impact of taxes on supply and demand (Page 3). It also notes that increased taxes reduce household and business spending, leading to lower demand for goods and services and ultimately lower economic growth (Page 5).

### Question 2
**Scenario:** In July 2021, the Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) adjusts the cash rate to influence borrowing costs after inflation rises to 3.5%, above its target range. A bank responds by increasing interest rates on home loans, affecting housing finance demand. The RBA aims to stabilize inflation to support long-term economic growth.

**Correct Answer:** B) Target: 2-3%; cash rate influences inflation and economic activity.  
**Explanation:** The document states that the RBA’s inflation target is to keep consumer price inflation at 2-3% over the medium term (Page 5). Adjusting the cash rate influences interest rates, affecting borrowing, lending, economic activity, and inflation (Page 5).

### Question 3
**Scenario:** A retail chain reports a 5% increase in sales in June 2021, contributing to economic activity. The Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) notes that retail sales are a key economic indicator, alongside GDP, which was $1.99 trillion in 2019. The chain’s success is attributed to stable consumer prices, with inflation at 1.1% in March 2021.

A) Role: measures export levels; inflation is above the RBA’s target.  
B) Role: measures consumer spending; inflation is below the RBA’s target.  
C) Role: tracks wage changes; inflation is within the RBA’s target.  
D) Role: monitors building approvals; inflation is above the RBA’s target.

**Correct Answer:** B) Role: measures consumer spending; inflation is below the RBA’s target.  
**Explanation:** The document identifies retail sales as an aggregated measure of consumer spending over a specific period (Page 3). The inflation rate of 1.1% in March 2021 (Page 4) is below the RBA’s target of 2-3% (Page 5).

### Question 4
**Scenario:** The Australian government announces a budget with increased spending on health and education, funded by borrowing, resulting in a budget deficit. An economist predicts this will boost economic activity but may increase inflation. The government aims to promote a stable environment for businesses through this fiscal policy.

**Question:** According to the document, what is a budget deficit, and how does increased government spending align with fiscal policy objectives?

The company’s CEO notes that the finance sector, contributing 8.9% to GDP in 2021, plays a critical role in supporting such projects, impacting macroeconomic indicators.

**Question:** Based on the document, what is the significance of building approvals as an economic indicator, and how does the finance sector’s GDP contribution reflect its economic role?

A) Approvals: measure price changes; finance sector drives export growth.  
B) Approvals: track construction activity; finance sector supports economic development.  
C) Approvals: monitor wage growth; finance sector reduces inflation.

### Question 6
**Scenario:** An exporter in Perth benefits from strong demand in 2019-2020, with 67% of Australia’s exports going to top destinations. The ABS reports that the balance of payments, reflecting these transactions, is a key economic indicator. However, rising net foreign debt raises concerns about economic stability.

**Question:** According to the document, what does the balance of payments measure, and how does rising net foreign debt impact economic stability?

A) Measures: domestic production; debt increases inflation.  
B) Measures: international transactions; debt poses risks to stability.  
C) Measures: consumer spending; debt reduces unemployment.  
D) Measures: wage changes; debt enhances export growth.

**Correct Answer:** B) Measures: international transactions; debt poses risks to stability.  
**Explanation:** The document defines the balance of payments as the record of all economic transactions between Australia and the world, including exports (Page 3). Rising net foreign debt, defined as financial obligations owed to other countries, can threaten economic stability (Page 3).

### Question 7
**Scenario:** The RBA decides to lower the cash rate to stimulate economic activity after the unemployment rate rises to 5.5%, above the reported 4.9% in July 2021. A bank adjusts its loan rates downward, encouraging borrowing for housing finance, which impacts investment dwellings.

**Question:** Based on the document, what is the unemployment rate’s role as an economic indicator, and how does the RBA’s cash rate adjustment align with its objectives?

A) Role: measures price changes; cash rate promotes wage growth.  
B) Role: measures workforce participation; cash rate supports full employment.

### Question 8
**Scenario:** A consumer notices a rise in the cost of groceries, contributing to a Consumer Price Index (CPI) increase to 2.5% in a quarter. The RBA monitors this closely to ensure it aligns with its inflation target. The government, meanwhile, invests in infrastructure to support economic stability.

**Question:** According to the document, what does the CPI measure, and how does the government’s infrastructure investment support its economic role?

A) CPI: measures wage changes; investment reduces unemployment.  
B) CPI: measures price changes; investment promotes a stable business environment.

### Question 9
**Scenario:** In 2021, the mining sector contributes 11.1% to Australia’s GDP, while the Wage Price Index shows a moderate increase in salaries. A bank uses these indicators to forecast loan demand, expecting growth in mining-related investments. The RBA maintains its independence in setting interest rates to manage these trends.

**Question:** Based on the document, what is the role of the Wage Price Index, and how does the RBA’s independence support its monetary policy?

A) Role: measures consumer spending; independence prevents political manipulation.
