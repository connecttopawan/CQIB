### Question 1: FATF and AML/CTF Compliance
**Scenario:** An Australian bank plans to expand its operations by opening a branch in a Southeast Asian country recently placed on the FATF’s "grey list" due to strategic deficiencies in its anti-money laundering and counter-terrorism financing (AML/CTF) regime. The bank’s compliance team must determine the best course of action to mitigate risks.

**Options:**  
A) Proceed with standard AML/CTF procedures as applied in Australia, assuming they suffice.  
B) Conduct enhanced due diligence on all transactions linked to the new branch.  
C) Await formal instructions from AUSTRAC before proceeding with the expansion.  
D) Suspend the expansion until the country is removed from the FATF grey list.

**Correct Answer:** B) Conduct enhanced due diligence on all transactions linked to the new branch.

**Explanation:** The Financial Action Task Force (FATF) identifies jurisdictions with AML/CTF deficiencies, placing them on its grey list to signal increased risk. For an Australian bank expanding into such a jurisdiction, FATF recommendations (implemented in Australia via the AML/CTF Act overseen by AUSTRAC) require heightened scrutiny. Enhanced due diligence is necessary to address the elevated risk of money laundering and terrorism financing, beyond standard Australian procedures. Waiting for AUSTRAC instructions or suspending operations may delay business unnecessarily, while standard procedures alone are insufficient given the FATF designation.

### Question 2: Basel Committee and Capital Requirements
**Scenario:** After a period of economic instability, the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (BCBS) introduces Basel IV, raising the minimum Common Equity Tier 1 (CET1) capital ratio from 10.5% to 12%. An Australian bank currently maintains a CET1 ratio of 11%. The bank’s board must decide how to comply with the new standard.

**Options:**  
A) Maintain the current CET1 ratio, as it exceeds the Basel III minimum.  
B) Increase CET1 capital to achieve the 12% ratio required by Basel IV.  
C) Request a temporary exemption from APRA due to economic conditions.  
D) Reduce total assets to artificially boost the CET1 ratio without raising capital.

**Correct Answer:** B) Increase CET1 capital to achieve the 12% ratio required by Basel IV.

**Explanation:** The BCBS sets global capital standards through the Basel Accords, which the Australian Prudential Regulation Authority (APRA) adopts for Australian banks. If Basel IV increases the CET1 minimum to 12%, a bank with an 11% ratio must either raise additional equity capital or reduce risk-weighted assets (RWA) to comply. Since the scenario does not indicate RWA adjustments as feasible, increasing CET1 capital is the direct solution. Maintaining the current ratio violates the new standard, exemptions are unlikely for core requirements, and reducing total assets without addressing RWA is impractical.

### Question 3: IOSCO and Derivatives Regulation
**Scenario:** An Australian investment bank engages in cross-border derivatives trading. The International Organization of Securities Commissions (IOSCO) releases updated principles requiring stricter oversight of over-the-counter (OTC) derivatives. The bank’s compliance officer assesses the impact on operations.

**Options:**  
A) Implement the IOSCO principles immediately to avoid international sanctions.  
B) Monitor ASIC’s response and adjust practices as local regulations evolve.  
C) Disregard the principles, as they lack direct legal force in Australia.  
D) Seek IOSCO certification to continue cross-border trading.

**Correct Answer:** B) Monitor ASIC’s response and adjust practices as local regulations evolve.

**Explanation:** IOSCO establishes global standards for securities markets, influencing national regulators like the Australian Securities and Investments Commission (ASIC). Its principles are not directly enforceable but guide ASIC’s regulatory framework. The bank should anticipate ASIC incorporating these principles into Australian law and adjust accordingly, rather than acting preemptively, ignoring them, or seeking irrelevant IOSCO certification (which does not exist for individual firms).

### Question 4: FSB and Systemic Risk
**Scenario:** The Financial Stability Board (FSB) warns of systemic risks from rapid growth in decentralized finance (DeFi) platforms. An Australian bank with exposure to DeFi through client investments must respond to maintain stability.

**Options:**  
A) Ban all DeFi-related transactions to preempt regulatory action.  
B) Collaborate with APRA and other FSB members to assess and mitigate risks.  
C) Continue operations unchanged, as FSB warnings are advisory only.  
D) Increase capital reserves unilaterally to offset potential losses.

**Correct Answer:** B) Collaborate with APRA and other FSB members to assess and mitigate risks.

**Explanation:** The FSB coordinates global financial stability policies, and Australia, as a member, works through regulators like APRA to address identified risks. Collaboration ensures a consistent, informed response to DeFi-related threats, balancing innovation and stability. A total ban may be excessive, ignoring the FSB risks misalignment with national policy, and unilateral capital increases may not address the systemic nature of the issue.

### Question 5: BIS and Digital Currencies
**Scenario:** The Bank for International Settlements (BIS) publishes a report advocating central bank digital currencies (CBDCs) to enhance payment efficiency. The Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) is exploring a digital Australian dollar. A major bank considers its role in this shift.

**Options:**  
A) Lobby the RBA to adopt a CBDC based on BIS findings.  
B) Prepare infrastructure to support a potential CBDC, anticipating RBA policy.  
C) Reject CBDC integration, as BIS reports are not mandatory.  
D) Wait for BIS directives before taking any action.

**Correct Answer:** B) Prepare infrastructure to support a potential CBDC, anticipating RBA policy.

**Explanation:** The BIS facilitates central bank cooperation and research, influencing but not dictating RBA decisions. A proactive bank would align its systems with a potential CBDC, given the RBA’s exploration and BIS support, to remain competitive. Lobbying may overstep the bank’s role, rejecting CBDCs ignores market trends, and waiting for BIS directives misinterprets its advisory function.

### Question 6: IMF and Financial Stability
**Scenario:** The International Monetary Fund (IMF) conducts a Financial Sector Assessment Program (FSAP) in Australia, highlighting vulnerabilities in shadow banking oversight. Australian regulators and banks must respond.

**Options:**  
A) Dismiss the FSAP findings, as the IMF lacks enforcement power.  
B) Implement IMF recommendations directly without local review.  
C) Assess the findings with APRA and ASIC to strengthen regulation.  
D) Request IMF funding to overhaul the shadow banking sector.

**Correct Answer:** C) Assess the findings with APRA and ASIC to strengthen regulation.

**Explanation:** The IMF’s FSAP provides non-binding assessments of financial stability, which Australian regulators like APRA and ASIC use to inform policy. Reviewing and adapting to the findings ensures a tailored response to local conditions. Dismissing them risks overlooking vulnerabilities, direct implementation bypasses sovereignty, and funding is irrelevant for regulatory adjustments.

### Question 7: IAIS and Climate Risk
**Scenario:** The International Association of Insurance Supervisors (IAIS) updates its Insurance Core Principles to mandate climate risk stress testing. An Australian bank with an insurance subsidiary evaluates its obligations.

**Options:**  
A) Apply the IAIS principles directly to the subsidiary’s operations.  
B) Await APRA’s adoption of the principles into Australian standards.  
C) Conduct voluntary stress tests to preempt IAIS enforcement.  
D) Ignore the principles, as they apply only to standalone insurers.

**Correct Answer:** B) Await APRA’s adoption of the principles into Australian standards.

**Explanation:** The IAIS sets global insurance standards, which APRA integrates into Australian regulations for insurers, including bank subsidiaries. Compliance is required only once APRA adopts the principles, not directly from IAIS. Voluntary tests may be proactive but are not mandated, and ignoring the principles risks future non-compliance when APRA acts.

### Question 8: G20 and Tax Transparency
**Scenario:** The G20 commits to a global framework for automatic exchange of tax information. An Australian bank with international clients must adapt its processes.

**Options:**  
A) Enforce the G20 framework on all clients immediately.  
B) Align systems with ATO and OECD standards reflecting G20 commitments.  
C) Apply the framework only to non-Australian clients.  
D) Delay action until the G20 imposes penalties.

**Correct Answer:** B) Align systems with ATO and OECD standards reflecting G20 commitments.

**Explanation:** G20 agreements, like tax transparency, are implemented in Australia via the Australian Taxation Office (ATO) and OECD frameworks (e.g., Common Reporting Standard). The bank must comply with these local standards, which reflect G20 goals, rather than enforcing G20 policies directly, selectively, or waiting for penalties.

### Question 9: FATF and Non-Compliance Consequences
**Scenario:** An international audit reveals an Australian bank’s failure to fully implement FATF’s customer due diligence standards. The bank’s risk committee assesses potential fallout.

**Options:**  
A) Face direct penalties from FATF for non-compliance.  
B) Report the issue to AUSTRAC and address deficiencies.  
C) Risk Australia’s placement on the FATF blacklist.  
D) Dismiss the audit, as FATF lacks jurisdiction over individual banks.

**Correct Answer:** B) Report the issue to AUSTRAC and address deficiencies.

**Explanation:** FATF sets AML/CTF standards enforced in Australia by AUSTRAC under the AML/CTF Act. Non-compliance by a bank triggers AUSTRAC oversight, requiring reporting and remediation, not direct FATF penalties (which target jurisdictions). Blacklisting applies to countries, not banks, and dismissal invites regulatory action from AUSTRAC.

### Question 10: FSB and Crisis Management
**Scenario:** Amid a global economic downturn, the FSB urges banks to conserve capital by halting dividends. An Australian bank, facing shareholder pressure to pay dividends, consults its options.

**Options:**  
A) Adhere to the FSB’s directive, halting dividends immediately.  
B) Engage APRA to determine if local guidance aligns with the FSB.  
C) Pay dividends, as FSB recommendations are not binding.  
D) Request FSB approval to maintain dividend payments.

**Correct Answer:** B) Engage APRA to determine if local guidance aligns with the FSB.

**Explanation:** The FSB’s non-binding recommendations influence national regulators like APRA, which may issue binding directives on capital preservation. The bank must consult APRA to confirm local policy, balancing shareholder expectations with stability goals. Ignoring the FSB risks misalignment with APRA, and seeking FSB approval is unnecessary.
