### Question 1
**Scenario**: A regional bank is considering whether to approve a loan for a mining company that plans to operate in an environmentally sensitive area. The loan would create jobs and boost the local economy, but there are concerns about potential environmental damage and harm to indigenous communities. The bank's board is divided, with some members prioritizing economic growth and others emphasizing the bank's social responsibility.

**Question**: Based on the principles of ethics in banking, what should be the primary consideration for the bank in making this decision?

A) The potential profit from the loan and its impact on the bank's financial performance.  
B) The legal compliance requirements and regulatory approvals needed for the loan.  
C) The long-term environmental and social impact on the community and the bank's reputation.  
D) The immediate economic benefits to the local area, such as job creation and increased tax revenue.

**Correct Answer**: C) The long-term environmental and social impact on the community and the bank's reputation.  
**Explanation**: Ethics in banking requires a stakeholder-centric approach, considering the broader implications on all stakeholders, including the environment and society. The bank must prioritize its social licence to operate by weighing the environmental and social impact against short-term economic gains, as emphasized in the document’s focus on stakeholder responsibilities (Page 4).

### Question 2
**Scenario**: A bank employee, John, discovers that his colleague, Sarah, has been manipulating customer accounts to meet sales targets. John is torn between reporting Sarah's misconduct, which could lead to her termination, and maintaining loyalty to his team, as Sarah is a long-time friend and has a family to support.

B) Report Sarah's misconduct immediately to the compliance department.

### Question 3
**Scenario**: A bank is developing a new high-yield investment scheme with complex features and risks, targeted at retail investors who may not fully understand the risks. The marketing team proposes an aggressive sales campaign to maximize uptake, but there are concerns about whether the product is in the best interests of customers.

**Question**: From an ethical standpoint, what is the most important factor the bank should consider before launching this product?

### Question 4
**Scenario**: A bank has a policy prohibiting lending to companies in certain industries, such as tobacco or firearms. A major client requests a loan to expand their business in one of these prohibited industries, arguing that the loan would create significant economic benefits and that the policy is outdated.

**Question**: Should the bank approve the loan, and why?

A) Yes, because the economic benefits outweigh the ethical concerns.  
B) No, because the bank must strictly adhere to its written policies.  
C) Yes, but only if the bank updates its policy to allow such loans.  
D) No, because the bank must consider the broader societal impact and its ethical stance.

**Correct Answer**: D) No, because the bank must consider the broader societal impact and its ethical stance.  
**Explanation**: Ethics in banking goes beyond following rules and requires considering societal impacts (Page 4). The policy reflects the bank’s ethical stance against supporting harmful industries. Approving the loan could harm the bank’s reputation and social licence, unless a compelling ethical reason justifies reconsideration.

### Question 5
**Scenario**: A bank’s remuneration system rewards employees based on the number of new accounts opened, regardless of their suitability for customers. This has led to instances where employees opened accounts without full customer consent or pushed unsuitable products to meet targets.

**Question**: What is the primary ethical issue with this remuneration system?

A) It does not align with the bank’s profit maximization goals.  
B) It creates a conflict of interest between employees’ incentives and customers’ best interests.  
C) It is not compliant with regulatory requirements for fair lending practices.  
D) It fails to motivate employees to perform at their best.

**Correct Answer**: B) It creates a conflict of interest between employees’ incentives and customers’ best interests.  
**Explanation**: The document highlights that remuneration systems should prioritize customer interests over profit (Page 10). Rewarding quantity over quality can lead to unethical behavior, such as mis-selling, which harms customers and undermines trust, as seen in the Hayne Royal Commission findings.
