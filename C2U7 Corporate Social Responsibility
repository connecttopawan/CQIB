## Question 1
What is the primary definition of Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) in the context of banking, as outlined in 
the FINSIA Professional Banking Fundamentals?

A. The practice of banks focusing solely on maximizing shareholder profits.  
B. The responsibility of banks to comply with all legal requirements.  
C. The commitment of banks to operate ethically and contribute to economic development while improving the quality 
of life for the workforce, their families, and the broader community and society.  
D. The process by which banks manage their environmental impact exclusively.

**Answer:** C  
**Explanation:** According to the FINSIA document, CSR in banking extends beyond profit-making and legal compliance 
to encompass ethical behavior and positive contributions to society. It involves accountability for economic, social, 
and environmental impacts, often referred to as the "triple bottom line" approach, which prioritizes improving the 
quality of life for stakeholders and society at large.

## Question 2
Why is CSR considered a critical focus for banks according to the FINSIA document?

A. It is a new regulatory requirement imposed on all banks.  
B. It enhances public standing and provides a competitive advantage through integration into corporate governance.  
C. It is primarily relevant for small community banks.  
D. It focuses solely on environmental sustainability.

**Answer:** B  
**Explanation:** The document highlights CSR as a "hot topic" due to increasing societal pressure on banks to 
integrate CSR into their corporate governance. This integration enhances public standing, builds trust, and provides 
a competitive advantage by aligning business practices with societal expectations.

## Question 3
Which of the following is NOT a key principle of CSR in banking as outlined in the FINSIA document?

A. Ethical conduct  
B. Responsiveness to social expectations  
C. Prioritizing shareholder profits above all else  
D. Acting as a good community citizen

**Answer:** C  
**Explanation:** The FINSIA document outlines CSR principles such as ethical conduct, responsiveness to social 
expectations, going beyond compliance, balancing stakeholder interests, good citizenship, and sustainability. 
Prioritizing shareholder profits above all else contradicts the stakeholder-focused approach of CSR, which emphasizes 
balancing the interests of shareholders with those of the wider community.

## Question 4
How does CSR differ from ethics in the context of banking, according to the FINSIA document?

A. CSR focuses on legal compliance, while ethics focuses on moral principles.  
B. CSR emphasizes obligations to all stakeholders, while ethics focuses on determining right and wrong based on 
moral principles.  
C. CSR and ethics are identical concepts with no differences.  
D. Ethics is a subset of CSR, focusing only on employee conduct.

**Answer:** B  
**Explanation:** The document distinguishes CSR from ethics by noting that while both involve values beyond profit, 
ethics focuses on moral principles of right and wrong, whereas CSR emphasizes broader obligations to all stakeholders, 
including economic, social, and environmental responsibilities.

## Question 5
In the Pyramid of Corporate Social Responsibility, as described in the FINSIA document, what forms the foundation level?

A. Philanthropic responsibilities  
B. Ethical responsibilities  
C. Legal responsibilities  
D. Economic responsibilities

**Answer:** D  
**Explanation:** The Pyramid of CSR, attributed to Carroll, categorizes responsibilities into four levels: economic, 
legal, ethical, and philanthropic. Economic responsibilities, such as earning profits and maintaining efficiency, 
form the foundation, as they are essential for a bank’s survival and ability to fulfill other responsibilities.

## Question 6
What is the primary purpose of ISO 26000 in the context of CSR for banks?

A. To certify banks as socially responsible organizations.  
B. To provide voluntary guidance on social responsibility practices.  
C. To enforce mandatory CSR regulations.  
D. To measure the financial outcomes of CSR initiatives.

**Answer:** B  
**Explanation:** ISO 26000 is an international standard that provides voluntary guidance on social responsibility. 
It helps banks assess and improve their social impact through principles like accountability, transparency, and 
respect for stakeholder interests, rather than serving as a certification or mandatory regulation.

## Question 7
Which of the following is a recognized benefit of implementing CSR in banking?

A. Increased regulatory penalties  
B. Enhanced competitive advantage  
C. Decreased community engagement  
D. Reduced investor confidence

**Answer:** B  
**Explanation:** The FINSIA document notes that implementing CSR can lead to benefits such as enhanced competitive 
advantage, improved reputation, better talent attraction and retention, increased employee morale, stronger investor 
relations, and improved community relationships, all of which contribute to a bank’s long-term success.

## Question 8
What is a potential consequence for banks that fail to address their social responsibilities?

A. Improved financial performance  
B. Reputational damage  
C. Enhanced employee morale

**Answer:** B  
**Explanation:** Failing to address social responsibilities can result in significant risks, including reputational 
damage, financial losses, and regulatory challenges. The document emphasizes that neglecting CSR can harm a bank’s 
trust and standing with stakeholders.

## Question 9
How do Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) factors relate to CSR in banking?

A. ESG factors are identical to CSR principles.  
B. ESG factors provide a measurable framework to assess the outcomes of CSR efforts.  
C. ESG factors are unrelated to CSR and focus solely on financial performance.  
D. ESG factors apply only to environmental initiatives.

**Explanation:** The document explains that ESG factors are related but distinct from CSR, serving as a measurable 
framework to evaluate the outcomes of CSR efforts, particularly in terms of sustainability and investor performance. 
ESG helps quantify the social and environmental impacts of a bank’s CSR initiatives.

## Question 10

A. Launching a high-yield investment product  
B. Supporting community development through sustainable lending practices  
C. Expanding branch networks for profit growth  
D. Increasing executive compensation

**Answer:** B  
**Explanation:** CSR initiatives in banking focus on contributing to societal and environmental goals, such as 
supporting sustainable development or community involvement. Supporting community development through sustainable 
lending practices aligns with the document’s emphasis on sustainability and positive societal impact, unlike profit-
driven or internal-focused activities.
