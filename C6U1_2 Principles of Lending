## Question 1
Which of the following is generally considered an unacceptable purpose for a bank loan according to standard lending 
principles?

A. Constructing a new home  
B. Refinancing an existing mortgage  
C. Purchasing a time-share property  
D. Renovating an existing property  

**Answer: C**  
**Explanation:** Time-share properties are generally unsuitable as loan security due to their complex ownership 
structures and limited resale value, making them an unacceptable purpose for a bank loan. Constructing a new home, 
refinancing an existing mortgage, and renovating an existing property are typically acceptable purposes as they align 
with standard lending criteria.

## Question 2
What is the primary reason banks may request multiple quotes for a loan intended for home improvements?

A. To ensure the loan amount is sufficient for the project  
B. To verify the cost estimates and prevent over-borrowing  
C. To negotiate better rates with contractors  
D. To assess the borrower's financial planning skills  

**Answer: B**  
**Explanation:** Banks request multiple quotes to verify the accuracy of cost estimates for home improvements, ensuring 
the borrower does not borrow more than necessary. This practice helps manage risk by aligning the loan amount with 
actual project costs, preventing over-borrowing.

## Question 3
How is the Loan to Value Ratio (LVR) typically calculated?

A. (Loan Amount / Asset Value) × 100  
B. (Asset Value / Loan Amount) × 100  
C. (Loan Amount - Asset Value) × 100  
D. (Asset Value - Loan Amount) × 100  

**Answer: A**  
**Explanation:** The Loan to Value Ratio (LVR) is calculated as (Loan Amount / Asset Value) × 100, using the lower of 
the asset’s cost or the bank’s valuation. This metric assesses the risk level of a loan by comparing the loan amount 
to the value of the securing asset.

## Question 4
What is a potential disadvantage of choosing a longer loan term?

A. Higher monthly repayments  
B. Lower total interest paid over the life of the loan  
C. Increased total interest paid over the life of the loan  
D. Reduced flexibility in repayment options  

**Answer: C**  
**Explanation:** A longer loan term reduces monthly repayments but increases the total interest paid over the life of 
the loan due to the extended period over which interest accrues. This trade-off is a key consideration in loan 
structuring.

## Question 5
What is a key characteristic of an Interest Only loan compared to a Principal and Interest (P&I) loan?

A. Lower total interest paid over the life of the loan  
B. Higher monthly repayments  
C. Repayment of only the interest for a specified period  
D. No requirement to repay the principal at any time  

**Answer: C**  
**Explanation:** An Interest Only loan requires the borrower to pay only the interest for a specified period 
(typically up to 5 years), after which it converts to a Principal and Interest (P&I) loan. In contrast, a P&I loan 
requires repayment of both principal and interest from the start.

## Question 6
In lending decisions, what is considered the most critical factor?

A. The value of the collateral provided  
B. The borrower's past credit history  
C. The borrower's ability and willingness to repay the loan  
D. The interest rate offered on the loan  

**Answer: C**  
**Explanation:** The borrower’s ability and willingness to repay the loan is the most critical factor in lending 
decisions, as it directly impacts the likelihood of default. While collateral and credit history are important, 
repayment capacity is paramount.

## Question 7
For a self-employed borrower, which of the following documents is typically required to verify income?

A. Recent pay slips  
B. Three years of financial statements  
C. PAYG summaries  
D. Bank statements for the last 3 months  

**Answer: B**  
**Explanation:** For self-employed borrowers, lenders typically require three years of financial statements to verify 
income, as pay slips and PAYG summaries are less reliable for reflecting their variable earnings. Bank statements may 
be supplementary but are not sufficient alone.

## Question 8
Why is it important for lenders to verify a borrower’s outstanding loans from other institutions?

A. To ensure the borrower is not overcommitted and can handle additional debt  
B. To check for any history of late payments  
C. To determine the total debt-to-income ratio  
D. All of the above  

**Answer: D**  
**Explanation:** Verifying outstanding loans ensures the borrower is not overcommitted, checks their repayment history, 
and helps calculate the total debt-to-income ratio. These factors collectively assess the borrower’s creditworthiness 
and ability to manage additional debt.

## Question 9
What should a lender do if a borrower’s repayment capacity is insufficient, even if they offer substantial security?

A. Approve the loan but with a higher interest rate  
B. Reject the loan application  
C. Request additional security to cover the shortfall  
D. Offer a longer loan term to reduce monthly repayments  

**Answer: B**  
**Explanation:** If a borrower’s repayment capacity is insufficient, the lender should reject the loan application, as 
repayment ability is the primary consideration. Additional security or adjusted terms do not compensate for the 
inability to repay.

## Question 10
Which principle of lending emphasizes the need for banks to maintain a balance between risk and return?

A. Safety  
B. Liquidity  
C. Profitability  
D. Diversification  

**Answer: C**  
**Explanation:** The profitability principle ensures that loans generate sufficient returns to cover costs and contribute to the bank’s financial sustainability, balancing risk with return. Safety focuses on repayment, liquidity on cash conversion, and diversification on risk spreading.
