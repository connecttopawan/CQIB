**Correct Answer:** B) It develops global standards for banking regulation and supervision  

**Explanation:** The Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (BCBS), hosted by the Bank for International Settlements (BIS), creates frameworks like the Basel Accords (e.g., Basel III) to improve banking stability through standards on capital adequacy, risk management, and liquidity.
