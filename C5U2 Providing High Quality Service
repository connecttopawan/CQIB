B. Banks lack sufficient resources to train staff adequately.  
C. Technology in banking is not advanced enough to support high-quality service.  
D. Customers are generally dissatisfied with banking services.  

**Answer:** A  
**Explanation:** High-quality service is subjective, influenced by customers’ previous experiences, expectations, 
thoughts, and mood. This variability makes it challenging to deliver consistently great service to all customers. 
Options B, C, and D are not identified as primary reasons in the context of customer service challenges.

## Question 2
**Which of the following is NOT a characteristic of great service in banking?**  
A. A welcoming environment
B. Quick and efficient service
C. Over-promising and under-delivering
D. Knowledgeable and competent employees

**Answer:** C  
**Explanation:** Great service includes a welcoming environment, quick and efficient service, and knowledgeable staff. 
Over-promising and under-delivering is a characteristic of poor service, as it fails to meet customer expectations.

## Question 3
**What is a key benefit of providing high-quality service to banking customers?**  
A. Reduced operational costs for the bank  
B. Increased employee turnover  
C. Generation of additional business and revenue  
D. Decreased need for customer contact centres  

**Answer:** C  
**Explanation:** High-quality service generates additional business and revenue, new referrals, repeat business, and 
builds a positive reputation. Options A, B, and D are not directly cited as benefits of high-quality service.

## Question 4
**Which of the following is a contributing factor to providing high-quality service in banking?**  
A. Treating customers as a homogeneous group  
B. Being ethical, professional, and responsible  
C. Focusing solely on efficiency without regard to effectiveness  
D. Limiting staff training to reduce costs  

**Answer:** B  
**Explanation:** Being ethical, professional, responsible, accurate, reliable, and courteous is a key factor in 
delivering high-quality service. Treating customers as a homogeneous group, focusing only on efficiency, or limiting 
training does not support individualized, effective service.

## Question 5
**What role do customer contact centres play in modern banking?**  
A. They handle only routine transactions.  
B. They manage a wide range of inquiries, including complex products.  
C. They are primarily used for telemarketing.  
D. They have decreased in importance due to digital transformation.  

**Answer:** B  
**Explanation:** Customer contact centres have evolved to manage a wide range of inquiries, including complex products 
like investments and pensions, beyond just routine transactions. They remain critical despite digital transformation 
and are not primarily for telemarketing.

## Question 6
**What does the Net Promoter Score (NPS) measure in the context of banking?**  
A. The number of customer complaints received  
B. The likelihood of customers recommending the bank to others  
C. The average transaction value per customer  
D. The customer's satisfaction with specific products  

**Answer:** B  
**Explanation:** NPS measures customer loyalty based on the likelihood of recommending the bank, using a 0-10 scale to 
categorize customers as Promoters, Passives, or Detractors. It does not measure complaints, transaction values, or 
product-specific satisfaction.

## Question 7
**How should bank staff demonstrate respect to customers?**  
A. By always agreeing with the customer's requests  
B. By using technical jargon to demonstrate expertise  
C. By being empathetic and using the customer's name  
D. By prioritizing efficiency over personal interaction  

**Answer:** C  
**Explanation:** Demonstrating respect involves empathy, using the customer’s name, being attentive, and ensuring 
privacy, among other actions. Agreeing with all requests, using jargon, or prioritizing efficiency over interaction 
does not align with respectful service.

## Question 8

A. It helps in cross-selling products to customers.  
B. It protects sensitive financial information and builds trust.  
C. It is required only for high-net-worth individuals.  
D. It reduces the bank's liability in case of data breaches.  

**Answer:** B  
**Explanation:** Confidentiality protects sensitive financial information and builds trust, adhering to the Australian 
Privacy Principles (APPs) and the Privacy Act 1998. It is not limited to high-net-worth individuals, nor is it 
primarily for cross-selling or liability reduction.

## Question 9
**What is a current trend in customer contact centres in banking?**  
A. Reduction in the use of technology  
B. Shift towards entirely automated services  
C. Integration of AI and analytics for better customer service  
D. Decreased focus on omnichannel communication  

**Answer:** C  
**Explanation:** Current trends include integrating AI and analytics, omnichannel communication, self-service tools, 
and digital transformation to enhance customer service. Contact centres are not shifting to entirely automated services 
or reducing technology use.

## Question 10

A. Only the customer service department  
B. All employees, as customer service is everyone’s responsibility  
C. Primarily the branch managers  
D. External consultants hired for service improvement  

**Answer:** B  
**Explanation:** Customer service is everyone’s responsibility, not just a department’s, as great experiences drive 
advocacy and business growth. Branch managers and consultants may contribute, but the responsibility is bank-wide.
