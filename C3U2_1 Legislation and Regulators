## Question 1
**Which regulatory body is primarily responsible for ensuring that financial institutions remain financially sound 
and meet their obligations to depositors, policyholders, and fund members?**

A. Australian Securities and Investments Commission (ASIC)  
B. Australian Prudential Regulation Authority (APRA)  
C. Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC)  
D. Treasury  

**Answer:** B. Australian Prudential Regulation Authority (APRA)  
**Explanation:** APRA is tasked with maintaining the prudential standards of financial institutions, such as banks, 
insurance companies, and superannuation funds, to ensure they remain financially sound and can meet their obligations 
to depositors, policyholders, and fund members. ASIC focuses on corporate and financial services regulation, including 
market integrity and consumer protection. The ACCC promotes competition and consumer protection under the *Competition 
and Consumer Act 2010*. Treasury is responsible for economic and fiscal policy, not direct regulation of financial 
institutions.

## Question 2
**Under the *Corporations Act 2001*, which criterion would classify a client as a wholesale client?**

A. The client is a small business with fewer than 20 employees.  
B. The client has net assets of less than $2.5 million.  
C. The client is investing more than $500,000 in a financial product.  
D. The client has not provided a written acknowledgement of being a sophisticated investor.  

**Answer:** C. The client is investing more than $500,000 in a financial product.  
**Explanation:** According to the *Corporations Act 2001*, a client is classified as a wholesale client if the investment 
in a financial product exceeds $500,000 (excluding risk-based products like life insurance or superannuation). A small 
business with fewer than 20 employees is typically a retail client. Having net assets less than $2.5 million does not 
qualify a client as wholesale, as the threshold is $2.5 million or more. A written acknowledgement is required for sophisticated 
investors, but the $500,000 investment criterion is a direct qualification for wholesale status.

## Question 3
**What is the primary purpose of the Product Design and Distribution Obligations (DDO) introduced by the *Treasury 
Amendment (Design and Distribution Obligations and Product Intervention Powers) Act 2019*?**

A. To ensure that financial products are only sold to wholesale clients.  
B. To require issuers to develop a Target Market Determination (TMD) for their products.  
C. To prohibit the sale of complex financial products to retail clients.  
D. To increase the regulatory powers of ASIC over financial product issuers.  

**Answer:** B. To require issuers to develop a Target Market Determination (TMD) for their products.  
**Explanation:** The DDO, effective from 5 October 2021, mandates that issuers create a TMD to ensure financial products 
are designed and distributed to meet the needs of a specific target market, reducing the risk of consumer harm. It does 
not restrict products to wholesale clients, prohibit complex products, or solely focus on enhancing ASIC’s powers, 
though it does grant ASIC product intervention powers.

## Question 4
**Which of the following is NOT a responsibility of the Australian Treasury in the context of financial regulation?**

A. Developing economic and fiscal policy.  
B. Administering the *Corporations Act 2001*.  
C. Participating in international forums like the G20.  
D. Coordinating with other regulatory bodies through the Council of Financial Regulators (CFR).  

**Answer:** B. Administering the *Corporations Act 2001*.  
**Explanation:** The *Corporations Act 2001* is administered by ASIC, not Treasury. Treasury’s responsibilities include 
developing economic and fiscal policy, participating in international forums like the G20, and coordinating with regulators 
through the CFR to enhance financial system stability and regulatory efficiency.

## Question 5
**Which is a key obligation for holders of an Australian Financial Services Licence (AFSL) under the *Corporations Act 2001*?**

A. Ensuring that all employees have a university degree in finance.  
B. Providing a Financial Services Guide (FSG) to all clients.  
C. Only offering financial products to wholesale clients.  
D. Maintaining a physical office in Australia.  

**Answer:** B. Providing a Financial Services Guide (FSG) to all clients.  
**Explanation:** AFSL holders must provide an FSG to clients to disclose information about the services offered, fees,
and other relevant details, as required by the *Corporations Act 2001*. There is no mandate for employees to have a
finance degree, no restriction to only wholesale clients, and no requirement for a physical office in Australia.

## Question 6
**What is the primary function of the Council of Financial Regulators (CFR)?**

A. To enforce prudential standards on financial institutions.  
B. To coordinate and facilitate information sharing among key financial regulators.  
C. To develop and implement monetary policy.  
D. To investigate and prosecute breaches of financial services laws.  

**Answer:** B. To coordinate and facilitate information sharing among key financial regulators.  
**Explanation:** The CFR, a non-statutory body comprising Treasury, RBA, ASIC, and APRA, facilitates information 
sharing, discusses regulatory issues, and coordinates responses to financial stability threats. Prudential standards 
are enforced by APRA, monetary policy is developed by the RBA, and investigations are primarily handled by ASIC.

## Question 7
**What was a significant change introduced by the *Financial Services Reform Act 2001* (FSRA) to the *Corporations Act 2001*?**

A. The establishment of a single licensing regime for financial services.  
B. The creation of the Australian Prudential Regulation Authority (APRA).  
C. The introduction of the Australian Consumer Law (ACL).  
D. The prohibition of margin lending facilities.  

**Answer:** A. The establishment of a single licensing regime for financial services.  
**Explanation:** The FSRA amended the *Corporations Act 2001* by introducing a single licensing regime and consistent 
disclosure requirements for financial services. APRA was established under the *Australian Prudential Regulation Authority 
Act 1998*, the ACL is part of the *Competition and Consumer Act 2010*, and margin lending facilities are not prohibited.

## Question 8
**Which legislation does the ACCC primarily administer to promote competition and fair trade?**

A. *Corporations Act 2001*  
B. *Banking Act 1959*  
C. *Competition and Consumer Act 2010*  
D. *Australian Prudential Regulation Authority Act 1998*  

**Answer:** C. *Competition and Consumer Act 2010*  
**Explanation:** The ACCC administers the *Competition and Consumer Act 2010*, which includes the Australian Consumer 
Law (ACL), to promote competition, fair trade, and consumer protection. The *Corporations Act 2001* is administered by 
ASIC, the *Banking Act 1959* by APRA, and the *Australian Prudential Regulation Authority Act 1998* governs APRA’s 
operations.

## Question 9
**What was one of the key reforms introduced by the Future of Financial Advice (FOFA) in 2012?**

A. Banning conflicted remuneration.  
B. Reducing disclosure requirements for wholesale clients.  
C. Allowing financial advisors to charge higher fees.  
D. Establishing the Council of Financial Regulators (CFR).  

**Answer:** A. Banning conflicted remuneration.  
**Explanation:** The FOFA reforms, introduced in 2012, amended the *Corporations Act 2001* to ban conflicted remuneration 
(e.g., commissions), introduce a best interests duty, allow scaled advice, and mandate fee disclosure. Disclosure 
requirements for wholesale clients were not reduced, higher fees were not explicitly allowed, and the CFR is a separate 
entity not established by FOFA.

## Question 10
**Under the Product Design and Distribution Obligations, what must an issuer do with their Target Market Determination 
(TMD)?**

A. Submit it to ASIC for approval.  
B. Review it at least once every three years.  
C. Ensure that it aligns with the distributor's sales targets.  
D. Make it publicly available on their website.  

**Answer:** B. Review it at least once every three years.  
**Explanation:** Issuers must review their TMD at least every three years or more frequently if triggered by significant 
changes or monitoring outcomes, as per the DDO requirements. TMDs do not require ASIC approval, are not aligned with 
distributor sales targets, and are not mandated to be publicly available, though they must be accessible to distributors.

## Question 11
**Which is a requirement for an individual to be classified as a sophisticated investor under the *Corporations Act 
2001*?**

A. Having net assets of at least $2.5 million.  
B. Providing a written acknowledgement of their status.  
C. Being employed by a financial institution.  
D. Having a degree in finance or economics.  

**Answer:** B. Providing a written acknowledgement of their status.  
**Explanation:** A sophisticated investor must provide a written acknowledgement that they are investing on their own 
behalf and understand the risks, as per the *Corporations Act 2001*. Net assets of $2.5 million or more qualify for 
wholesale client status under the wealth criterion, not specifically sophisticated investors. Employment or education 
qualifications are not required.

## Question 12
**What is the purpose of ASIC's Regulatory Guides?**

A. To provide legally binding rules for financial services providers.  
B. To offer practical guidance on how to comply with the law.  
C. To outline the minimum capital requirements for ADIs.  
D. To detail the tax implications of financial products.  

**Answer:** B. To offer practical guidance on how to comply with the law.  
**Explanation:** ASIC’s Regulatory Guides (e.g., RG 104, RG 274) provide practical, non-binding guidance to help entities 
comply with legal obligations under legislation like the *Corporations Act 2001*. Capital requirements for ADIs are 
set by APRA, and tax implications are not covered by Regulatory Guides.

## Question 13
**What is a key responsibility of distributors under the Product Design and Distribution Obligations?**

A. Designing the financial product.  
B. Ensuring distribution aligns with the Target Market Determination (TMD).  
C. Approving the TMD before it is implemented.  
D. Conducting regular audits of the issuer's compliance.  

**Answer:** B. Ensuring distribution aligns with the Target Market Determination (TMD).  
**Explanation:** Distributors must ensure their distribution practices align with the TMD and report significant 
dealings or complaints to issuers within 10 business days, as per DDO requirements. Designing products and approving 
TMDs are issuer responsibilities, and audits are not a mandated distributor role.

## Question 14
**Which regulatory body has the power to issue enforceable directions and revoke licences of financial institutions?**

A. ASIC  
B. APRA  
C. ACCC  
D. Treasury  

**Answer:** B. APRA  
**Explanation:** APRA has the authority to issue enforceable directions and revoke licences of Authorised Deposit-taking 
Institutions (ADIs), insurance companies, and superannuation providers under the *Banking Act 1959* to ensure prudential 
compliance. ASIC enforces financial services laws, ACCC focuses on competition, and Treasury does not have direct 
enforcement powers.

## Question 15
**Which act incorporates the National Credit Code and regulates consumer credit in Australia?**

A. *Corporations Act 2001*  
B. *Competition and Consumer Act 2010*  
C. *National Consumer Credit Protection Act 2009*  
D. *Banking Act 1959*  

**Answer:** C. *National Consumer Credit Protection Act 2009*  
**Explanation:** The *National Consumer Credit Protection Act 2009*, administered by ASIC, incorporates the National 
Credit Code and regulates consumer credit and leases. The *Corporations Act 2001* governs financial services, the 
*Competition and Consumer Act 2010* covers competition and consumer protection, and the *Banking Act 1959* regulates 
ADIs.
