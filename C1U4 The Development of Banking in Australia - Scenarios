Question 4
Scenario: In the 1930s, during the Great Depression, a state-owned savings bank faces collapse due to economic downturns. The Commonwealth Bank steps in to acquire it, preventing further financial instability. At the time, banking is heavily regulated, limiting foreign banks’ ability to operate in Australia.
Question: Based on the document, what was a key action taken by the Commonwealth Bank during the Great Depression, and why were foreign banks limited in Australia?
A) Action: issuing private bank notes; foreign banks limited due to gold shortages.
B) Action: acquiring faltering savings banks; foreign banks limited due to tight regulations.
C) Action: introducing ATMs; foreign banks limited due to demutualization requirements.

Correct Answer: B) Impact: allowed banks to set interest rates; ATMs reduced operating costs.
Explanation: The document states that the RBA, created in 1960, assumed central banking functions, allowing banks to set their own interest rates and operate in the money market, while ATMs, introduced in 1969, helped reduce operating costs (Page 4).

Question 6
Scenario: In 1983, a bank expands its foreign exchange services after the Australian dollar is floated, removing foreign exchange controls. This follows the Campbell Committee’s recommendations in 1981 to deregulate financial activities, allowing banks to respond more flexibly to market demands.
Question: Based on the document, what was a key outcome of the Campbell Committee’s recommendations, and how did the floating of the Australian dollar benefit banks?
A) Outcome: introduced the four pillars policy; benefit: restricted foreign bank entry.
B) Outcome: increased deregulation; benefit: expanded foreign exchange services.
C) Outcome: privatized savings banks; benefit: increased ATM usage.
D) Outcome: created APRA; benefit: enhanced payment system security.
Correct Answer: B) Outcome: increased deregulation; benefit: expanded foreign exchange services.
Explanation: The document highlights that the Campbell Committee’s 1981 recommendations led to deregulation, giving banks greater freedom to respond to market signals, and the 1983 floating of the Australian dollar abolished foreign exchange controls, enabling banks to expand foreign exchange services (Page 4).

Question 7
Scenario: In 1997, Westpac acquires the Bank of Melbourne to strengthen its market position, despite the government’s four pillars policy preventing mergers among the major banks (ANZ, CBA, NAB, Westpac). The acquisition aligns with a trend of major banks absorbing smaller competitors.
Question: According to the document, what is the purpose of the four pillars policy, and how does Westpac’s acquisition of the Bank of Melbourne align with this policy?
A) Purpose: promote foreign bank entry; acquisition violates the policy.
B) Purpose: prevent mergers among major banks; acquisition is permitted as it involves a smaller bank.
C) Purpose: regulate payment systems; acquisition enhances electronic payments.
D) Purpose: privatize major banks; acquisition is unrelated to the policy.
Correct Answer: B) Purpose: prevent mergers among major banks; acquisition is permitted as it involves a smaller bank.
Explanation: The document explains that the four pillars policy, introduced in 1990, prevents mergers among the four major banks (ANZ, CBA, NAB, Westpac) but allows acquisitions of smaller competitors, such as Westpac’s acquisition of the Bank of Melbourne in 1997 (Page 5).

Question 8
Scenario: In 1998, a bank transitions its oversight from the Reserve Bank of Australia to the Australian Prudential Regulation Authority (APRA) following the Wallis Committee Report. The bank also adopts new payment system protocols under the newly created Payments System Board (PSB) to ensure transaction safety.
Question: Based on the document, what was the impact of the Wallis Committee Report, and what is the role of the Payments System Board?
A) Impact: privatized the Commonwealth Bank; PSB regulates foreign exchange.
B) Impact: transferred bank oversight to APRA; PSB ensures payment system safety.
C) Impact: introduced the four pillars policy; PSB manages bank mergers.
D) Impact: demutualized building societies; PSB oversees superannuation funds.
Correct Answer: B) Impact: transferred bank oversight to APRA; PSB ensures payment system safety.Explanation: The document states that the Wallis Committee Report in 1998 led to bank oversight being transferred from the RBA to APRA, and the Payments System Board was created to maintain the safety and performance of the payment system (Page 5).

Question 9
Scenario: In 2015, a bank implements new customer-focused policies in response to the Financial System Inquiry (FSI) recommendations. The FSI, announced in 2013, aims to enhance trust and fairness in the financial system, prompting the bank to improve its complaint resolution processes.
Question: According to the document, what was a key theme of the 2013 Financial System Inquiry, and how does the bank’s action align with this theme?
A) Theme: restrict bank mergers; action aligns by limiting acquisitions.

Correct Answer: B) Theme: enhance confidence and trust; action aligns by improving customer fairness.
Explanation: The document notes that the 2013 FSI aimed to enhance confidence and trust by creating an environment where financial firms treat customers fairly, and the bank’s improved complaint resolution processes align with this theme (Page 5).

Question 10
Scenario: In 2019, a customer submits a complaint to a bank about misconduct in its financial advisory services, referencing findings from the 2017 Royal Commission into Banking. The bank responds by implementing whistleblower protection policies and reviewing its remuneration practices, as part of the Better Banking Program.
Question: Based on the document, what was the purpose of the 2017 Royal Commission, and how does the bank’s response align with the Better Banking Program?
