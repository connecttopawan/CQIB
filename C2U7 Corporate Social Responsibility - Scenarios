## Question 1
**Scenario:** A regional bank is considering financing a new coal mine project that promises significant 
economic benefits, including job creation in an underserved area, but will contribute to carbon emissions 
and environmental degradation. The bank's CSR policy emphasizes environmental sustainability and community 
development.

**What should the bank do?**

A. Approve the financing, as the economic benefits outweigh the environmental concerns.  
B. Reject the financing, as it conflicts with the bank's CSR policy on environmental sustainability.  
C. Approve the financing but require the mining company to implement carbon offset measures.  
D. Delay the decision until further environmental impact assessments are completed.

**Answer:** C  
**Explanation:** CSR in banking requires balancing the triple bottom line—economic, social, and environmental 
considerations. While rejecting the project aligns with environmental goals, it may overlook social benefits 
like job creation. Approving the financing with carbon offset measures supports economic development while 
mitigating environmental harm, aligning with the bank’s CSR policy and the FINSIA emphasis on sustainable 
practices.

## Question 2
**Scenario:** During a bank’s annual budget meeting, the finance team pushes to maximize shareholder returns 
by increasing dividends, while the CSR department proposes funding a community education program that aligns 
with social responsibility goals but offers no immediate financial return.

**What is the most appropriate action for the bank?**

A. Prioritize shareholder returns and increase dividends.  
B. Allocate funds to the community education program, as CSR is a key part of the bank’s strategy.  
C. Split the budget equally between dividends and the community program.  
D. Conduct a cost-benefit analysis to evaluate the long-term impact of each option.

**Answer:** D  
**Explanation:** CSR involves balancing stakeholder interests, including shareholders and the community. 
Prioritizing dividends may satisfy shareholders but could harm long-term reputation and sustainability. 
A cost-benefit analysis ensures an informed decision that aligns with CSR objectives, considering both 
financial viability and social impact, as emphasized in the FINSIA framework.

## Question 3
**Scenario:** A bank discovers that a long-standing client, a major revenue source, has been accused of 
violating labor laws and exploiting workers. The bank’s CSR policy commits to fair labor practices.

**What should the bank do?**

A. Continue the business relationship, as the client is a significant revenue source.  
B. Immediately terminate the relationship with the client.  
C. Engage with the client to address the labor violations and ensure compliance.  
D. Publicly disclose the client’s violations to demonstrate transparency.

**Answer:** C  
**Explanation:** CSR requires upholding ethical standards and ensuring client alignment with these values. 
Terminating the relationship immediately may be premature, while continuing without action compromises 
integrity. Engaging with the client to address violations demonstrates the bank’s commitment to fair labor 
practices, aligning with FINSIA’s focus on ethical conduct and stakeholder responsibility.

## Question 4
**Scenario:** A bank is developing a green bond to fund renewable energy projects. Market research indicates 
low demand, suggesting the product may not be profitable in the short term.

**What should the bank consider most when deciding whether to launch this product?**

A. The potential profitability of the green bond.  
B. The alignment with the bank’s CSR objectives.  
C. The demand from customers for sustainable investment options.  
D. All of the above, with a focus on long-term sustainability and reputation.

**Answer:** D  
**Explanation:** CSR prioritizes long-term sustainability and reputation over short-term profitability. 
While profitability and customer demand are important, the bank must also consider its environmental commitments. 
Launching the green bond aligns with CSR goals and positions the bank as a leader in sustainable finance, as 
supported by FINSIA’s emphasis on societal impact.

## Question 5
**Scenario:** An employee requests unpaid leave to volunteer for a community project aligned with the bank’s 
CSR initiatives. Granting the leave would temporarily increase the workload for other team members.

**How should the bank handle this request?**

A. Deny the request to maintain team productivity.  
B. Approve the request, as it supports the bank’s CSR goals.  
C. Allow the employee to volunteer but require them to complete their work before leaving.  
D. Evaluate the impact on team performance and make a decision based on that.

**Answer:** B  
**Explanation:** CSR includes supporting employee engagement in social responsibility activities. Approving 
the request demonstrates commitment to community involvement, enhancing employee morale and the bank’s 
reputation. While productivity is a concern, the bank can manage workloads through temporary adjustments, 
aligning with FINSIA’s focus on stakeholder engagement.

## Question 6
**Scenario:** Shareholders pressure a bank to reduce CSR spending, arguing it does not directly contribute 
to profitability. The CSR department insists these initiatives are essential for long-term sustainability 
and stakeholder trust.

**What is the best way for the bank to resolve this conflict?**

A. Reduce CSR spending to satisfy shareholders.  
B. Maintain current CSR spending, emphasizing its importance for long-term sustainability.  
C. Increase CSR spending to demonstrate commitment to social responsibility.  
D. Engage in dialogue with shareholders to educate them on the benefits of CSR.

**Answer:** D  
**Explanation:** CSR requires balancing stakeholder interests. Reducing spending may appease shareholders 
but could harm long-term viability. Engaging with shareholders to explain CSR’s benefits—such as reputation, 
talent attraction, and risk management—aligns their expectations with the bank’s goals, reflecting FINSIA’s 
emphasis on stakeholder consideration.

## Question 7
**Scenario:** A bank implementing the ISO 26000 standard for social responsibility must assess its human rights 
impact. It discovers that a supplier has been accused of using child labor.

**What should the bank do first?**

A. Immediately terminate the relationship with the supplier.  
B. Investigate the accusations to verify their accuracy.  
C. Issue a public statement condemning child labor.  
D. Review its overall human rights policy.

**Answer:** B  
**Explanation:** ISO 26000 emphasizes accountability and transparency. Investigating the accusations ensures 
informed decision-making, avoiding premature termination or misleading public statements. Reviewing the 
policy is important but secondary to verifying the situation, aligning with FINSIA’s focus on ethical and 
responsible operations.

## Question 8
**Scenario:** A bank is preparing its annual ESG report. The finance team wants to highlight only positive 
achievements, while the CSR team insists on including both successes and areas for improvement.

**What should the bank do?**

A. Include only positive ESG performance to present the bank in the best light.  
B. Include both successes and areas for improvement to demonstrate transparency.  
C. Omit the ESG section altogether to avoid scrutiny.  
D. Let the board decide what to include.

**Answer:** B  
**Explanation:** Transparency is a core CSR principle. Including both successes and areas for improvement 
demonstrates accountability and builds stakeholder trust, aligning with ISO 26000 and FINSIA’s emphasis on 
ethical reporting. Omitting the section or highlighting only positives undermines credibility.

## Question 9
**Scenario:** Due to climate change, a bank faces increased risks from natural disasters affecting its loan 
portfolio in coastal areas. The Australian Prudential Regulation Authority (APRA) has issued guidance on 
managing climate-related financial risks.

**What should the bank do to address these risks?**

A. Increase lending in coastal areas to support affected communities.  
B. Withdraw from lending in high-risk areas.  
C. Assess and integrate climate-related risks into its risk management framework.  
D. Ignore the risks, as they are uncertain and long-term.

**Answer:** C  
**Explanation:** APRA’s guidance emphasizes managing climate-related risks. Assessing and integrating these 
risks into the bank’s framework ensures proactive mitigation, aligning with CSR’s environmental responsibility. 
Increasing lending in high-risk areas could exacerbate risks, while withdrawing may not be ethical, per FINSIA 
standards.

## Question 10
**Scenario:** A whistleblower reports that a senior manager involved in the bank’s CSR initiatives has engaged 
in fraudulent activities, impacting the bank’s public profile.

**How should the bank handle this situation?**

A. Protect the manager due to their importance in CSR initiatives.  
B. Investigate the allegations thoroughly, regardless of the manager’s role.  
C. Ignore the whistleblower’s report to avoid damaging the bank’s reputation.  
D. Publicly disclose the allegations to maintain transparency.

**Answer:** B  
**Explanation:** Integrity is fundamental to CSR. Investigating the allegations thoroughly upholds ethical 
standards, regardless of the manager’s role. Protecting or ignoring the issue compromises integrity, while 
premature disclosure could be harmful. This aligns with FINSIA’s focus on ethical conduct.
