### Question 10
The document provides data on the banking sector’s financial performance in 2019. If banks paid $14.2 billion in taxes and had cash earnings of $35 billion after tax, what was the approximate percentage of cash earnings paid as taxes?

A) 40.6%  
B) 28.8%  
C) 68.8%  
D) 50.0%

**Correct Answer**: A  
**Explanation**: To calculate the percentage of cash earnings paid as taxes, first determine the pre-tax earnings. The document states banks had $35 billion in cash earnings after tax and paid $14.2 billion in taxes. Pre-tax earnings = $35 billion + $14.2 billion = $49.2 billion. The tax percentage is ($14.2 billion / $49.2 billion) × 100 ≈ 28.86%. However, this represents the tax rate on pre-tax earnings. To find the percentage of cash earnings (post-tax) paid as taxes, we calculate ($14.2 billion / $35 billion) × 100 ≈ 40.57%, which rounds to 40.6%. Thus, the closest answer is A.
