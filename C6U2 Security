## Question 1
What is the primary purpose of banks taking security for loans?

A. To increase the interest rate on the loan.  
B. To mitigate the risk of borrower default.  
C. To ensure the loan is repaid on time.  
D. To comply with regulatory requirements.

**Answer: B**  
**Explanation:** Banks take security to reduce the risk of financial loss if a borrower defaults, particularly when 
repayment ability is uncertain. Security provides a fallback option, allowing the bank to recover funds by selling the 
pledged asset.

## Question 2
Which characteristic of high-quality security ensures clear and undisputed ownership?

A. Saleability  
B. Simplicity of title  
C. Stability of value  
D. Ease of valuation

**Answer: B**  
**Explanation:** Simplicity of title refers to an asset having straightforward ownership, free from liabilities or 
encumbrances, which facilitates efficient handling and sale in case of default.

## Question 3
Why is stability of value a critical attribute for security in lending?

A. To maximize loan profitability  
B. To ensure the asset retains sufficient value for recovery  
C. To attract more borrowers  
D. To simplify legal processes

**Answer: B**  
**Explanation:** Stability of value ensures that an asset’s worth does not significantly decline, allowing the bank to 
recover the loan amount through sale without substantial loss if the borrower defaults.

## Question 4
What does the term "saleability" mean in the context of loan security?

A. The asset’s ability to maintain consistent value  
B. The ease with which the asset can be converted to cash  
C. The legal clarity of the asset’s ownership  
D. The simplicity of assessing the asset’s worth

**Answer: B**  
**Explanation:** Saleability refers to how quickly and easily an asset can be sold to recover funds, minimizing delays 
and financial losses in case of borrower default.

## Question 5
Which asset is typically considered easy to value for security purposes?

A. Unique artwork  
B. Residential property  
C. Unlisted shares  
D. Specialized commercial property

**Answer: B**  
**Explanation:** Residential property is generally easier to value due to standardized market data and appraisal 
methods, unlike unique or specialized assets that require complex valuation processes.

## Question 6
Which type of asset is generally unacceptable as security for bank loans?

A. Term deposits  
B. Listed shares  
C. Time-share arrangements  
D. Residential property

**Answer: C**  
**Explanation:** Time-share arrangements are unsuitable as security due to their complex ownership structures and 
limited resale value, making them difficult to sell efficiently.

## Question 7
How should security be viewed in the lending process?

A. As the primary means of loan repayment  
B. As a secondary strategy to ensure repayment  
C. As unnecessary for creditworthy borrowers  
D. As the sole criterion for loan approval

**Answer: B**  
**Explanation:** Security serves as a backup measure; the primary focus in lending is the borrower’s ability to repay 
the loan from income or cash flow, ensuring sound lending practices.

## Question 8
What type of risk does security primarily mitigate in lending?

A. Interest rate risk  
B. Credit risk  
C. Liquidity risk  
D. Operational risk

**Answer: B**  
**Explanation:** Security primarily mitigates credit risk by providing collateral that can be sold to recover losses 
if the borrower fails to repay the loan.

## Question 9
Why might an uninhabitable property be rejected as security?

A. It lacks any market value  
B. It is difficult to sell or requires significant repairs  
C. It is prohibited by banking regulations  
D. It offers insufficient loan margin

**Answer: B**  
**Explanation:** Uninhabitable properties are typically rejected as security because they are hard to sell quickly and 
may require costly repairs, reducing their effectiveness as collateral.

## Question 10
What is the role of security in the lending process according to banking principles?

A. To guarantee full loan repayment  
B. To act as a safety net in case of default  
C. To enhance the bank’s profit margins  
D. To meet international lending standards

**Answer: B**  
**Explanation:** Security acts as a safety net, providing protection to the lender if the borrower defaults, but it 
does not replace the importance of assessing the borrower’s repayment capacity.
