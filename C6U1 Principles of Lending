## Question 1
Which of the following best encapsulates the principle of safety in lending as applied by banks?
A) Ensuring loans are disbursed only to borrowers with high credit scores  
B) Prioritizing the security of public funds by assessing the borrower’s ability to repay  
C) Diversifying loan portfolios across multiple industries to minimize risk  
D) Lending only to short-term projects to maintain liquidity  

**Correct Answer**: B  
**Explanation**: The principle of safety in lending emphasizes protecting the bank’s funds, which are primarily 
public deposits, by ensuring that loans are extended to borrowers with a demonstrated ability to repay. This involves 
thorough credit assessments, including repayment capacity, rather than solely relying on credit scores (A), 
diversification (C), or loan tenure (D). Safety focuses on minimizing the risk of default while safeguarding the 
bank’s financial stability.

## Question 2
What is the primary purpose of the principle of liquidity in the context of bank lending?  
A) To ensure loans are repaid within a short timeframe  
B) To maintain sufficient cash reserves to meet depositor demands  
C) To diversify lending across various asset classes  
D) To prioritize lending to low-risk borrowers  

**Correct Answer**: B  
**Explanation**: The principle of liquidity ensures that a bank maintains sufficient liquid assets to meet depositor 
withdrawals and other immediate obligations. While short-term loans (A) may contribute to liquidity, the principle is 
broader, focusing on the bank’s ability to access cash when needed. Diversification (C) relates to risk management, 
and prioritizing low-risk borrowers (D) aligns with safety, not liquidity.

## Question 3
How does the principle of diversification contribute to effective lending practices?  
A) By concentrating loans in a single sector to build expertise  
B) By spreading credit exposure across various borrowers and industries  
C) By increasing the loan-to-deposit ratio to maximize profitability  
D) By reducing the need for credit risk assessments  

**Correct Answer**: B  
**Explanation**: Diversification in lending involves spreading credit exposure across different borrowers, industries, 
and geographic regions to reduce the risk of significant losses from a single default or sector downturn. Concentrating 
loans (A) increases risk, increasing the loan-to-deposit ratio (C) is unrelated to diversification, and diversification 
does not eliminate the need for credit assessments (D).

## Question 4
Which factor is most critical when applying the principle of profitability in lending decisions?  
A) Maximizing interest rates on all loans  
B) Balancing the cost of funds with the return on loans  
C) Extending loans only to high-net-worth individuals  
D) Minimizing loan processing costs  

**Correct Answer**: B  
**Explanation**: The principle of profitability requires banks to balance the cost of acquiring funds (e.g., interest 
paid on deposits) with the returns generated from loans (e.g., interest earned). Maximizing interest rates (A) may 
deter borrowers, lending only to high-net-worth individuals (C) limits market scope, and minimizing processing costs 
(D) is secondary to achieving a sustainable return.

## Question 5
In the context of credit risk management, what role does the principle of stability play?  
A) Ensuring loans are aligned with short-term economic trends  
B) Maintaining consistent lending practices to support long-term economic growth  
C) Restricting loans to government-backed projects  
D) Avoiding lending during periods of economic uncertainty  

**Correct Answer**: B  
**Explanation**: The principle of stability in lending focuses on maintaining consistent and prudent lending practices 
that support sustainable economic growth, avoiding speculative or risky lending. Aligning with short-term trends (A) 
may increase volatility, restricting loans to government projects (C) is overly limiting, and avoiding lending during 
uncertainty (D) may hinder economic support.

## Question 6
Which regulatory requirement is most closely associated with ensuring banks adhere to priority sector lending norms?  
A) Capital Adequacy Ratio (CAR)  
B) Statutory Liquidity Ratio (SLR)  
C) Adjusted Net Bank Credit (ANBC) targets  
D) Cash Reserve Ratio (CRR)  

**Correct Answer**: C  
**Explanation**: Adjusted Net Bank Credit (ANBC) targets are used to enforce priority sector lending norms, requiring 
banks to allocate a specific percentage of their lending (e.g., 40% for commercial banks in India) to sectors like 
agriculture, MSMEs, and housing. CAR (A) ensures capital sufficiency, SLR (B) mandates investment in liquid assets, 
and CRR (D) requires cash reserves to be held with the central bank.

## Question 7
What is the primary objective of conducting a creditworthiness assessment before approving a loan?  
A) To determine the borrower’s eligibility for government subsidies  
B) To evaluate the borrower’s repayment capacity and credit risk  
C) To ensure compliance with anti-money laundering regulations  
D) To assess the borrower’s investment portfolio  

**Correct Answer**: B  
**Explanation**: A creditworthiness assessment evaluates a borrower’s ability to repay a loan and the associated credit 
risk, considering factors like income, credit history, and debt-to-income ratio. It is not primarily about subsidies (A), 
anti-money laundering compliance (C), or investment portfolios (D), though these may be secondary considerations.

---

## Question 8
Which of the following best describes the role of collateral in the lending process?  
A) It eliminates the need for credit risk assessment  
B) It serves as a secondary source of repayment in case of default  
C) It guarantees the profitability of the loan  
D) It ensures compliance with regulatory lending limits  

**Correct Answer**: B  
**Explanation**: Collateral provides a secondary source of repayment if the borrower defaults, reducing the bank’s 
credit risk. It does not eliminate the need for risk assessment (A), guarantee profitability (C), or directly ensure 
regulatory compliance (D), though it may support adherence to lending standards.

## Question 9
How does the principle of purpose influence lending decisions?  
A) It restricts loans to specific industries identified by the bank  
B) It ensures loans are used for productive and socially beneficial purposes  
C) It mandates loans be issued only for short-term needs  
D) It requires borrowers to provide detailed investment plans  

**Correct Answer**: B  
**Explanation**: The principle of purpose ensures that loans are extended for productive and socially beneficial 
activities, such as business expansion or housing, rather than speculative or harmful purposes. It does not restrict 
loans to specific industries (A), mandate short-term needs (C), or always require detailed investment plans (D).

## Question 10
Which of the following is a key component of the Know Your Customer (KYC) process in lending?  
A) Assessing the borrower’s investment returns  
B) Verifying the borrower’s identity and financial background  
C) Determining the market value of collateral  
D) Calculating the bank’s loan-to-deposit ratio  

**Correct Answer**: B  
**Explanation**: The KYC process involves verifying the borrower’s identity, financial background, and source of funds 
to mitigate risks like fraud and money laundering. It is not primarily about investment returns (A), collateral 
valuation (C), or the loan-to-deposit ratio (D).
