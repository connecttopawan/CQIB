1. **What is the primary distinction between general advice and personal advice in the context of financial services?**  
   - a) General advice is always free, while personal advice is always paid.  
   - b) General advice does not consider the individual's personal circumstances, while personal advice does.  
   - c) General advice is only provided by banks, while personal advice is only provided by independent advisers.  
   - d) General advice focuses on product features, while personal advice focuses on investment strategies.  
   **Answer:** b) General advice does not consider the individual's personal circumstances, while personal advice does.

This distinction is critical in financial services regulation, as it determines the legal obligations of the adviser.

9. **Why is it important for clients to understand whether they are receiving general or personal advice?**

   - c) Because the legal obligations and protections for clients differ between the two types of advice.  
   - d) Because personal advice is always better than general advice.  
   **Answer:** c) Because the legal obligations and protections for clients differ between the two types of advice.  
   **Explanation:** Clients need to understand the type of advice they are receiving because personal advice comes with higher legal obligations for the adviser, including the Best Interests Duty and the requirement to provide an SOA. This means clients have more protections when receiving personal advice compared to general advice, which has fewer regulatory requirements.
