## Question 1: Definition of Financial Product
**Question:**  
According to the Corporations Act 2001, a financial product is defined as:  
A. Any product that involves a financial investment.  
B. A facility through which a person makes a financial investment, manages financial risk, or makes non-cash payments.  
C. Any product sold by a bank or financial institution.  
D. A product that requires a license to sell.  

**Answer:** B  
**Explanation:**  
Section 763A of the Corporations Act 2001 defines a financial product as "a facility through which, or through the 
acquisition of which, a person makes a financial investment, manages financial risk, or makes non-cash payments.
" This definition excludes consumer credit contracts, which are regulated under the National Consumer Credit Protection 
Act 2009. Options A, C, and D are either too broad or inaccurate.

## Question 2: Types of Advice
**Question:**  
Which of the following is NOT a recognized type of advice in the context of financial product advice?  
A. Factual information  
B. General advice  
C. Personal advice  
D. Regulatory advice  

**Answer:** D  
**Explanation:**  
The document outlines three types of advice: factual information, general advice, and personal advice. Regulatory 
advice is not a recognized category in this context. This distinction is critical for understanding the scope of 
advice under the Corporations Act.

## Question 3: Factual Information
**Question:**  
As per RG 244.24, factual information is best described as:  
A. Advice that considers the customer’s specific financial situation.  
B. Objectively ascertainable information that cannot reasonably be questioned.  
C. General advice that does not consider the customer’s objectives.  
D. Personal advice tailored to the customer’s needs.  

**Answer:** B  
**Explanation:**  
Factual information, as defined in RG 244.24, is "objectively ascertainable information, the truth or accuracy of 
which cannot reasonably be questioned." Examples include providing insurance quotes or answering administrative queries. 
It does not involve recommendations or opinions, distinguishing it from advice.

## Question 4: General Advice Requirements
**Question:**  
Under Section 949A of the Corporations Act, what is a mandatory requirement when providing general advice?  
A. A detailed analysis of the customer’s financial situation.  
B. A warning that the advice does not account for the customer’s objectives, financial situation, or needs.  
C. A specific recommendation for a financial product.  
D. A Product Disclosure Statement (PDS) for all advice given.  

**Answer:** B  
**Explanation:**  
Section 949A mandates that general advice must include a warning that it does not take into account the customer’s 
objectives, financial situation, or needs, and that the customer should consider its appropriateness, potentially 
reviewing a PDS. This ensures transparency and protects customers from misinterpreting the advice.

## Question 5: Personal Advice Characteristics
**Question:**  
What primarily distinguishes personal advice from general advice under the Corporations Act?  
A. It is provided by a licensed advisor.  
B. It considers the customer’s specific financial situation, needs, or objectives.  
C. It requires a Product Disclosure Statement (PDS).  
D. It is delivered in writing only.  

**Answer:** B  
**Explanation:**  
Personal advice, as defined in Section 766B, considers one or more of the customer’s financial situation, needs, or 
objectives, or a reasonable person might expect such consideration. This distinguishes it from general advice, which 
is not tailored to the individual. Licensing is required for both types, and delivery format is not a defining factor.

## Question 6: Licensing Requirements
**Question:**  
Who is required to be licensed to provide financial product advice under the Corporations Act?  
A. Only those providing personal advice.  
B. Anyone providing advice on financial products.  
C. Providers of general advice but not factual information.  
D. Providers of both general and personal advice must be licensed by an Australian Financial Services Licensee (AFSL).  

**Answer:** D  
**Explanation:**  
The Corporations Act requires that providers of financial product advice, whether general or personal, must be licensed 
by an Australian Financial Services Licensee (AFSL). Factual information does not require a license, as it is not 
considered advice.

## Question 7: Disclosure Documents
**Question:**  
Which documents must be provided to retail customers when offering financial products?  
A. Financial Services Guide (FSG) only  
B. Product Disclosure Statement (PDS) only  
C. Both Financial Services Guide (FSG) and Product Disclosure Statement (PDS)  
D. Neither, if the advice is factual information  

**Answer:** C  
**Explanation:**  
Retail customers must receive both the Financial Services Guide (FSG), which details the service provider, fees, and 
complaint procedures, and the Product Disclosure Statement (PDS), which outlines the product’s features, benefits, 
risks, costs, and cooling-off periods. This ensures informed decision-making.

## Question 8: Hawking Prohibition
**Question:**  
Since October 5, 2021, what practice is prohibited for financial products offered to retail clients?  
A. Providing general advice without a warning.  
B. Selling financial products through unsolicited contact (hawking).  
C. Offering personal advice without a license.  
D. Providing factual information without a license.  

**Answer:** B  
**Explanation:**  
Following the Royal Commission into Misconduct in the Banking, Superannuation, and Financial Services Industry, 
hawking—selling financial products through unsolicited contact like phone calls or door-to-door visits—was prohibited 
for retail clients as of October 5, 2021, to protect consumers from pressure sales.

## Question 9: Consent for Unsolicited Contact
**Question:**  
What is the validity period for customer consent for unsolicited contact regarding financial products?  
A. Indefinitely, until withdrawn.  
B. Six months.  
C. Six weeks.  
D. One year.  

**Answer:** C  
**Explanation:**  
The document specifies that customer consent for unsolicited contact regarding financial products is valid for six weeks. 
Consent must be clear, voluntary, and positive, and customers can specify preferences or withdraw consent at any time.

## Question 10: Distinguishing Advice Types
**Question:**  
What is the primary characteristic that distinguishes personal advice from general advice?  
A. The format in which the advice is given (written vs. verbal).  
B. Whether the advice is provided by a licensed advisor.  
C. Whether the advice takes into account the customer’s specific financial situation, needs, or objectives.  
D. The type of financial product being advised on.  

**Answer:** C  
**Explanation:**  
The primary distinction between personal and general advice is that personal advice considers the customer’s specific 
financial situation, needs, or objectives, as per Section 766B of the Corporations Act. General advice does not account 
for these factors, requiring a warning to clarify its scope.
