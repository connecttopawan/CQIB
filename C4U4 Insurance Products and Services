## Question 1
**What is the primary purpose of an insurance contract from the policyholder's perspective?**  
A. To provide a savings mechanism for future financial needs.  
B. To transfer the risk of an adverse event to the insurer in exchange for a premium.  
C. To guarantee a fixed return on investment for the policyholder.  
D. To regulate the financial services industry and ensure consumer protection.  

**Answer:** B  
**Explanation:** Insurance is fundamentally about transferring risk. The policyholder pays a premium to the insurer, 
who assumes the risk of specified adverse events (e.g., property damage, illness, or death). This protects the 
policyholder from significant financial losses. Options A, C, and D are incorrect, as insurance is not a savings 
mechanism, does not guarantee returns, and is not primarily for industry regulation.

## Question 2
**Which regulatory body in Australia oversees the prudential regulation of insurance companies under the *Insurance 
Act 1973 (Cth)*?**  
A. ASIC (Australian Securities and Investments Commission)  
B. APRA (Australian Prudential Regulation Authority)  
C. RBA (Reserve Bank of Australia)  
D. ACCC (Australian Competition and Consumer Commission)  

**Answer:** B  
**Explanation:** The Australian Prudential Regulation Authority (APRA) regulates insurance companies under the 
*Insurance Act 1973 (Cth)*, ensuring financial stability and compliance. ASIC focuses on consumer protection and 
licensing, while the RBA and ACCC have roles unrelated to prudential insurance regulation.

## Question 3
**What is the key distinction between an indemnity policy and a replacement value policy?**  
A. Indemnity policies cover the cost of new items, while replacement value policies cover the depreciated value.  
B. Indemnity policies aim to restore the policyholder to their pre-loss position, while replacement value policies 
cover the cost of replacing items with new ones.  
C. Indemnity policies are only available for life insurance, while replacement value policies are for general insurance.  
D. Indemnity policies have no excess, while replacement value policies always include an excess.  

**Answer:** B  
**Explanation:** Indemnity policies compensate for the actual financial loss, restoring the policyholder to their 
pre-loss position without profit. Replacement value policies cover the cost of replacing damaged or lost items with 
new ones, regardless of depreciation, often resulting in higher premiums. Options A, C, and D misrepresent these 
definitions.

## Question 4
**Which of the following is NOT typically covered under a standard home and contents insurance policy?**  
A. Damage to the building structure due to fire.  
B. Theft of personal belongings.  
C. Loss of income due to the homeowner’s inability to work.  
D. Damage to contents due to storm or flood.  

**Answer:** C  
**Explanation:** Home and contents insurance typically covers building damage (e.g., from fire, storm) and contents 
(e.g., theft, flood damage). Loss of income due to inability to work is covered under income protection insurance, 
a type of life insurance, not general home and contents insurance.

## Question 5
**What does trauma insurance typically provide?**  
A. A lump sum payment if the policyholder dies.  
B. A lump sum payment if the policyholder becomes permanently disabled.  
C. A lump sum payment if the policyholder is diagnosed with a specified critical illness.  
D. Monthly income if the policyholder is temporarily unable to work due to illness.  

**Answer:** C  
**Explanation:** Trauma insurance provides a lump sum payment upon diagnosis of a specified critical illness (e.g., 
cancer, stroke). It differs from life insurance (death), TPD insurance (permanent disability), and income protection 
(temporary income loss).

## Question 6
**How does selecting a higher excess on an insurance policy generally affect the premium?**  
A. It increases the premium.  
B. It decreases the premium.  
C. It has no effect on the premium.  
D. It only affects the claim payout, not the premium.  

**Answer:** B  
**Explanation:** A higher excess reduces the insurer’s risk by requiring the policyholder to pay more out-of-pocket 
during a claim, leading to lower premiums. Options A, C, and D are incorrect, as the excess directly influences the 
premium cost.

## Question 7
**Under the *Insurance Contracts Act 1984 (Cth)*, what is the primary duty imposed on both the insurer and the insured?**  
A. The duty of care.  
B. The duty of utmost good faith.  
C. The duty to disclose all information, regardless of relevance.  
D. The duty to act in the best interest of the other party.  

**Answer:** B  
**Explanation:** The *Insurance Contracts Act 1984 (Cth)* mandates that both parties act with utmost good faith, 
ensuring honesty and transparency in disclosures and dealings. The duty of disclosure applies only to material 
information, making option C incorrect.

## Question 8
**Which of the following insurance premiums is generally tax-deductible for an individual?**  
A. Home and contents insurance.  
B. Motor vehicle insurance.  
C. Income protection insurance for personal use.  
D. Life insurance for personal use.  

**Answer:** C  
**Explanation:** Income protection insurance premiums are generally tax-deductible for individuals, as they replace 
income during illness or injury. Premiums for home, motor vehicle, and life insurance are typically not tax-deductible 
for personal use.

## Question 9
**How do Australian banks typically offer insurance products following the divestment of their insurance divisions?**  
A. By directly underwriting insurance policies.  
B. Through partnerships with third-party insurance providers.  
C. By offering insurance as part of banking products without separate premiums.  
D. By referring customers to independent insurance brokers.  

**Answer:** B  
**Explanation:** Post-divestment, banks partner with third-party insurers to offer insurance products, earning 
financial benefits from sales and administration. Options A, C, and D do not reflect this current practice.

## Question 10
**What is a key factor to consider when recommending insurance products to a customer?**  
A. The customer’s age.  
B. The customer’s income and financial obligations.  
C. The customer’s credit score.  
D. The customer’s preferred banking institution.  

**Answer:** B  
**Explanation:** A customer’s income and financial obligations are critical to ensure insurance coverage aligns with 
their financial needs and risks. Age, credit score, and banking preference are less directly relevant.
