## Question 1  
**What is the primary purpose of Key Risk Indicators (KRIs) in a banking context?**  
A) To replace Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) in financial reporting  
B) To measure and monitor the exposure and control effectiveness of significant risks  
C) To eliminate all risks associated with banking operations  
D) To standardize risk reporting across all industries  

**Answer:** B) To measure and monitor the exposure and control effectiveness of significant risks  
**Explanation:** Page 3 defines KRIs as metrics that measure the amount of exposure to risks, the effectiveness of 
controls, and how well risks are managed, serving as a "health check" for risk control, not replacing KPIs or 
eliminating risks.

## Question 2  
**Which characteristic is NOT essential for a Key Risk Indicator (KRI) to be effective?**  
A) Measurable as a number, count, percentage, or dollar volume  
B) Predictable to provide early warning signals  
C) Standardized across all business units regardless of context  
D) Comparable to track trends over time  

**Answer:** C) Standardized across all business units regardless of context  
**Explanation:** Page 3 lists KRI characteristics as measurable, predictable, comparable, and informational. Page 4 
notes that KRIs may differ across business units, indicating they are not necessarily standardized, making this the 
correct exclusion.

## Question 3  
**What distinguishes a Key Risk Indicator (KRI) from a general risk indicator?**  
A) A KRI tracks only minor risks, while a risk indicator tracks major risks  
B) A KRI tracks particularly important risks or does so particularly well  
C) A KRI is used only for financial risks, while a risk indicator covers operational risks  
D) A KRI is reported only to regulators, while a risk indicator is internal  

**Answer:** B) A KRI tracks particularly important risks or does so particularly well  
**Explanation:** Page 3 states that a risk indicator becomes a KRI when it tracks a particularly important risk 
exposure or does so particularly well, distinguishing it from general risk indicators, not based on the type of risk 
or reporting audience.

## Question 4  
**What is a key function of a risk register in risk management?**  
A) To replace the need for a Risk Appetite Statement  
B) To log and monitor key risks and their control measures for a project or business unit  
C) To conduct risk assessments for new projects  
D) To set thresholds for Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)  

**Answer:** B) To log and monitor key risks and their control measures for a project or business unit  
**Explanation:** Page 4 defines a risk register as a tool to log key risks, their details, and control measures for 
monitoring and reporting, not for replacing RAS, conducting assessments, or setting KPI thresholds.

## Question 5  
**Which of the following is NOT typically included in a risk register?**  
A) Reference numbers assigned to each identified risk (Risk ID)  
B) The likelihood or probability of the risk occurring  
C) The financial performance targets of the business unit  
D) The residual risk rating after controls are applied  

**Answer:** C) The financial performance targets of the business unit  
**Explanation:** Page 4 lists risk register components like Risk ID, likelihood, impact, controls, and residual risk 
rating. Financial performance targets are unrelated to risk management documentation, making this the correct exclusion.

---

## Question 6  
**How are tolerances or limits typically used in relation to risk indicators?**  
A) To define the financial goals of the bank  
B) To alert management to potential problems when thresholds are exceeded  
C) To eliminate the need for risk registers  
D) To standardize risk ratings across all risks  

**Answer:** B) To alert management to potential problems when thresholds are exceeded  
**Explanation:** Page 4 explains that tolerances or limits tied to risk indicators alert management to potential 
problems when exceeded, triggering appropriate actions, not defining financial goals or eliminating registers.

## Question 7  
**In the context of risk impact ratings, how is the severity of a risk event calculated?**  
A) By adding the estimated financial impact to the probability of occurrence  
B) By multiplying the estimated financial impact by the probability of occurrence  
C) By dividing the financial impact by the number of controls applied  
D) By assessing only the historical loss data  

**Answer:** B) By multiplying the estimated financial impact by the probability of occurrence  
**Explanation:** Page 6 describes that risk severity is calculated by multiplying the estimated financial impact by 
the probability of occurrence (e.g., $5,000,000 × 30% = $1,500,000), ensuring consistency in risk assessment.

## Question 8  
**What is a key benefit of maintaining a risk register for a banking project or business unit?**  
A) It guarantees the elimination of all identified risks  
B) It ensures consistency and completeness of documented risk information  
C) It replaces the need for Key Risk Indicators (KRIs)  
D) It focuses solely on financial performance metrics  

**Answer:** B) It ensures consistency and completeness of documented risk information  
**Explanation:** Page 7 lists benefits of a risk register, including consistency and completeness of documented risk 
information across projects or units, not eliminating risks or replacing KRIs.

---

## Question 9  
**Why are Key Risk Indicators (KRIs) considered early warning signals in risk management?**  
A) They measure only historical risk events  
B) They track changes in risk exposure over time to alert management  
C) They focus exclusively on regulatory compliance issues  
D) They eliminate the need for risk treatment plans  

**Answer:** B) They track changes in risk exposure over time to alert management  
**Explanation:** Page 3 notes that KRIs act as early warning signals by tracking risk exposure and control effectiveness 
over time, alerting management to potential issues, not focusing solely on historical events or compliance.

## Question 10  
**When assessing a risk impact rating, what factors are primarily considered?**  
A) The bank’s strategic objectives and financial targets  
B) The estimated financial impact and probability of the risk occurring  
C) The number of employees involved in risk mitigation  
D) The regulatory requirements for risk reporting  

**Answer:** B) The estimated financial impact and probability of the risk occurring  
**Explanation:** Page 6 explains that risk impact ratings consider the estimated financial impact and probability of a 
risk event occurring, often using historical loss data and management assessments, not employee numbers or strategic 
objectives directly.
