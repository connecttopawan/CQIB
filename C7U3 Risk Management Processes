## Question 1  
**What is the primary purpose of integrating risk management processes into a bank’s general management?**  
A) To eliminate all risks associated with banking operations  
B) To ensure risk management is embedded in the bank’s culture and tailored to its business processes  
C) To delegate risk management responsibilities solely to the board  
D) To focus exclusively on meeting regulatory obligations  

**Answer:** B) To ensure risk management is embedded in the bank’s culture and tailored to its business processes  
**Explanation:** Page 3 states that risk management processes should be integral to a bank’s general management, 
embedded in its culture and practices, and tailored to its needs and business processes, ensuring a holistic approach 
beyond just regulatory compliance or board delegation.

## Question 2  
**Which of the following is NOT a benefit of effective risk management processes as outlined in the document?**  
A) Accurately measuring risk exposure within the bank’s risk appetite  
B) Optimizing financial growth opportunities while mitigating potential losses  
C) Guaranteeing complete elimination of residual risk  
D) Protecting depositors, policyholders, and investors by maintaining a strong balance sheet  

**Answer:** C) Guaranteeing complete elimination of residual risk  
**Explanation:** Page 3 lists benefits such as measuring risk exposure, optimizing growth, and protecting stakeholders. 
Page 6 notes that residual risk remains after mitigation efforts, indicating that complete elimination is not feasible, 
making this the correct exclusion.

## Question 3  
**According to ISO 31000:2018, what is the first step in conducting an effective risk management process?**  
A) Risk identification  
B) Establishing the context  
C) Risk treatment  
D) Monitoring and review  

**Answer:** B) Establishing the context  
**Explanation:** Page 3 references ISO 31000:2018, stating that establishing the context is the initial step, involving 
understanding internal and external factors like the board’s risk appetite, governance, and regulatory obligations, 
before proceeding to other steps like risk identification.

## Question 4  
**What is the purpose of risk evaluation in the risk management process?**  
A) To identify new risks that may emerge during operations  
B) To compare the level of risk with established risk criteria to determine acceptability  
C) To implement controls to mitigate identified risks  
D) To analyze the likelihood and consequences of risks  

**Answer:** B) To compare the level of risk with established risk criteria to determine acceptability  
**Explanation:** Page 4 defines risk evaluation as comparing the analyzed risk level against risk criteria (reflecting 
risk appetite, policies, and regulations) to assess acceptability and determine if risk treatment is needed, 
distinguishing it from analysis or treatment.

## Question 5  
**Which risk identification technique is most suitable for a bank initiating a major project or change?**  
A) Loss data capture and analysis  
B) Workshops with project representatives and specialists  
C) Near miss analysis  
D) Questionnaires distributed to all employees  

**Answer:** B) Workshops with project representatives and specialists  
**Explanation:** Page 5 highlights workshops as a technique used when starting a project or implementing major 
changes, involving project representatives and specialists to identify risks, facilitated by risk and compliance 
teams, making it more targeted than the other options.

## Question 6  
**What does a risk matrix primarily help a bank achieve during risk analysis?**  
A) To select appropriate risk treatment options  
B) To communicate risks to external stakeholders  
C) To examine the likelihood and consequences of risks to assign a risk rating  
D) To monitor the effectiveness of existing controls  

**Answer:** C) To examine the likelihood and consequences of risks to assign a risk rating  
**Explanation:** Page 6 explains that a risk matrix is used to analyze risks by examining their likelihood and impact, 
resulting in a color-coded risk rating, which guides further evaluation and management, not treatment selection or 
monitoring.

## Question 7  
**Which of the following is NOT a risk mitigation option listed in the document?**  
A) Avoid the risk by not engaging in the activity  
B) Accept the risk to pursue an opportunity  
C) Eliminate all consequences of the risk  
D) Transfer the risk to another party  

**Answer:** C) Eliminate all consequences of the risk  
**Explanation:** Page 6 lists mitigation options as avoid, accept, remove, reduce, transfer, and change. While 
“change” involves altering consequences, no option claims to eliminate all consequences, as residual risk remains, 
making this the correct exclusion.

## Question 8  
**Why is communication and consultation with stakeholders essential throughout the risk management process?**  
A) To delegate risk management responsibilities to external parties  
B) To ensure transparency in decision-making and secure support for risk treatment plans  
C) To replace the need for risk monitoring and review  
D) To focus solely on regulatory compliance reporting  

**Answer:** B) To ensure transparency in decision-making and secure support for risk treatment plans  
**Explanation:** Page 7 emphasizes that communication and consultation ensure transparency in decision-making, 
consider stakeholder interests, and secure endorsement for treatment plans, enhancing risk management effectiveness, 
not replacing monitoring or focusing only on compliance.

---

## Question 9  
**What is a key consideration when selecting a risk treatment option?**  
A) Ensuring the treatment eliminates all residual risk  
B) Balancing the costs and efforts of implementation against the benefits  
C) Applying the same treatment to all identified risks  
D) Avoiding any consultation with stakeholders  

**Answer:** B) Balancing the costs and efforts of implementation against the benefits  
**Explanation:** Page 6 states that selecting risk mitigation options involves balancing implementation costs and 
efforts against benefits, including legal and regulatory requirements, rather than eliminating all residual risk or 
applying uniform treatments.

## Question 10  
**What is the primary purpose of monitoring and review in the risk management process?**  
A) To identify new risks before they occur  
B) To ensure controls are effective and to detect changes in risk context  
C) To implement risk treatment options  
D) To conduct initial risk assessments  

**Answer:** B) To ensure controls are effective and to detect changes in risk context  
**Explanation:** Page 7 describes monitoring and review as ensuring controls are effective and efficient, improving 
risk assessments, analyzing lessons learned, and detecting changes in internal/external contexts or emerging risks, 
distinguishing it from initial assessments or treatments.
